## 📍 The Process

I wanted to create a visually striking and interactive way to present my favorite anime series. Inspired by bold title cards and character spotlights, I used GSAP for advanced text and image animations, ensuring each hover feels lively and unique. The color palette is tuned for maximum contrast on a dark background, and the codebase is structured for clarity and maintainability. Accessibility and responsiveness were also priorities, so the gallery works well across devices and with screen readers.
